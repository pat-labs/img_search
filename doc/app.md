## Preparation Steps

1. **Prepare Dataset**

   - [Flowers Dataset 5 Categories](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/flowers-dataset?resource=download)
   - [102 Category Flower Dataset ](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)
2. **Feature Extraction**

   - Try different descriptors (e.g., SIFT for accuracy, ORB/BRISK for speed).
   - Normalize descriptors to ensure consistency across datasets.
3. **Clustering**

   - Apply Bag of Words for lightweight clustering.
   - Use Fisher Matrix for richer, high-dimensional representation.
   - Compare cluster quality in terms of compactness and retrieval speed.
4. **Indexing**

   - Test FAISS for large-scale, GPU-accelerated search.
   - > Explore Ribbon Filter for lightweight pre-filter.
     >
   - > Consider Chroma for semantic embeddings (if textual/image metadata is used).
     >
5. **Database Integration**

   - Use **Neo4j** to model relationships (tags ↔ images ↔ descriptors).
   - Use **ChromaDB** for storage of raw descriptors and metadata.

## The Tasting (Evaluation Metrics)

To evaluate performance, compare different ingredient combinations using:

- **Accuracy / Recall**
  - Percentage of correct matches retrieved (Top-1, Top-5 accuracy).
- **Precision**
  - How many retrieved matches are actually relevant.
- **Retrieval Time**
  - Latency from query to result (important for scalability).
- **Memory Usage**
  - How efficiently descriptors and indices are stored.
- **Cluster Quality**
  - Use metrics like **Silhouette Score** or **Davies–Bouldin Index**.
- **Scalability**
  - Performance as dataset size grows (10k, 100k, 1M images).
- **Robustness**
  - How well the system handles noise, rotation, or partial occlusion.

## Suggested Combinations & Optimization


| Combination                             | Rationale & Focus                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ORB + BoW + FAISS + MongoDB             | Focus: Speed and Efficiency. ORB is faster than SIFT; MongoDB is often faster for simple reads than Neo4j. Best for large, performance-critical datasets.                                                 |
| SIFT + Fisher Matrix + FAISS + Neo4j    | Focus: Quality and Rich Relationships. SIFT/Fisher Matrix provides high-quality encoding; Neo4j is excellent for complex queries like "Show me all objects tagged 'rose' that are located in 'Garden A'." |
| AKAZE + FAISS (with Index-IVF) + Chroma | Focus: Robustness and Modern Tools. AKAZE performs well on scaled/blurred images. Using a vector database like Chroma streamlines the indexing and retrieval into one component.                          |

Dimensionality reduction: PCA → product quantization (PQ) for FAISS; or use small autoencoder for compression.
Evaluate cluster with Silhouette Score, DB Index, and retrieval-level metrics (MAP).

Tip: Combine FAISS (precision) with HNSW (speed) for scalable hybrid search.
