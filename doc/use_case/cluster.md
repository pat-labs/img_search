# Feature: Comparative Cluster Analysis

**As a** Computer Vision Engineer  
**I want** to evaluate the performance of **clustering and representation methods** (Bag of Words, Fisher Matrix, and Machine Learning-based models)  
**So that** I can select the most suitable clustering approach for the production image recognition pipeline.  

---

## I want to be able to:

1. **Cluster Implementation**  
   - Implement a standardized function interface for generating feature clusters from descriptors.  
   - Support the following methods:  
     - **Bag of Words (BoW)** with k-means or hierarchical k-means.  
     - **Fisher Matrix (Fisher Vectors)** with Gaussian Mixture Models.  
     - **ML-based models** (e.g., autoencoders, supervised classifiers, or learned embeddings) for advanced representation.  
   - Ensure consistent input/output formats for interoperability with indexing and database modules.  

2. **Transformation Pipeline**  
   - Build an automated pipeline to test cluster robustness under controlled image transformations:  
     - **Rotation**: Apply at increments (e.g., 15°, 45°, 90°).  
     - **Illumination Change**: Adjust brightness/contrast (−25%, +25%, +50%).  
   - Ensure reproducibility by storing original and transformed images alongside cluster assignments.

## It is done when:

1. **Quantitative Performance Report**  
   - A comprehensive report compares all clustering approaches using the following metrics:  
     - **Cluster Compactness & Separation**: Quantified using Silhouette Score and Davies–Bouldin Index.  
     - **Retrieval Accuracy**: Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Top-k accuracy on the transformed test set.  
     - **Scalability & Latency**: Average runtime (in ms) for clustering and retrieval at different dataset sizes.  
     - **Memory Efficiency**: Storage footprint (in MB/GB) for cluster centroids, histograms, or learned embeddings.  

2. **Optimal Model Recommendation**  
   - The report provides a **clear, data-driven recommendation** for the optimal clustering method.  
   - The recommendation must justify the trade-off between **retrieval accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **scalability**, considering production hardware and dataset growth.
