# Feature: Comparative Analysis and Selection of Image Descriptors

**As a** Computer Vision Engineer
**I want** to evaluate the performance of leading image descriptor algorithms (SIFT, ORB, KAZE, etc.)
**So that** I can select the most suitable descriptor for the production image recognition pipeline.

---

## I want to be able to:

1. **Descriptor Implementation**

   - Implement a standardized function interface for extracting keypoints and descriptors across multiple algorithms: **SIFT, ORB, KAZE, AKAZE, BRISK, SIFT-FREAK.
   - Ensure consistency in input/output formats to simplify benchmarking and integration into downstream tasks.
2. **Transformation Pipeline**

   - Build an automated pipeline to apply controlled transformations to a baseline set of test images:
     - **Rotation**: Apply rotations at fixed increments (e.g., 15°, 45°, 90°).
     - **Illumination Change**: Adjust brightness/contrast at defined levels (e.g., −25%, +25%, +50%).
   - Ensure reproducibility by storing both original and transformed images with metadata.

---

## It is done when:

1. **Quantitative Performance Report**

   - A comprehensive report compares all implemented descriptors using the following metrics:
     - **Repeatability Score**: Percentage of keypoints from the baseline image that are also correctly detected in transformed images.
     - **Time Efficiency (Latency)**: Average runtime (in ms) to extract descriptors from the sample dataset.
     - **Descriptor Size**: Memory footprint (in bytes) required to store the descriptor vector.
2. **Optimal Model Recommendation**

   - The report provides a **clear, data-driven recommendation** of the optimal descriptor model.
   - The recommendation must explicitly justify the trade-off between **Repeatability Score** and **Time Efficiency**, considering the constraints of the target hardware.
