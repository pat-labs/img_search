# Abstract: Image-Based Object Search and Information Retrieval System

---

## **Goal**

This project aims to develop an **image-based object search and information retrieval system**. The primary objective is to allow a user to **identify an object** from a photo, retrieve all associated **tags and stored information**, and provide a confidence level for the match.

## **Methods**

The system will be built around a **graph database** for efficient storage and retrieval of interconnected image data and metadata. The core methodology involves:

1. **Feature Extraction:** Utilizing the **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** algorithm to generate distinctive descriptors for all images in the database.
2. **Clustering and Indexing:** Applying clustering techniques to group the **most relevant SIFT descriptors**. Each cluster will be assigned a unique **index** to facilitate rapid searching.
3. **Search Mechanism:** When a new photo is submitted for search, its SIFT descriptors will be extracted and compared against the indexed database clusters.
4. **Information Retrieval:** A successful match (e.g., $\ge 90\%$ similarity to a cluster) will retrieve the corresponding object's **tags and information** (e.g., "is a rose"), which are linked within the graph database structure.

## **Expected Outcome**

The resulting system will provide a robust and fast method for object recognition, transforming image data into structured, retrievable information. This enables users to quickly identify objects and access relevant data, significantly improving the utility of personal or professional image collections.
Another scope:

- enhance the image quality
- stich the image with another to complete the panoram
- change object for another
- paralele processing kmeans
- map reduce for descriptors
- hashmap con uso de atomic integer
